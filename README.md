# QML syntax file for VIM

vim has support for QML as of
[2023-08-20](https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/bedc69f9d67b117ab05aa735c701cd3899d1ae2d) so I
strongly suggest using that if possible.

I will leave this repository up for people who cannot use the new vim version (the change mentioned
above is not yet in a released version), but will archive it sometime during 2024.

## Notes
I take absolutely no credit for this - all I did was write the ftdetect line and package it.

The actual syntax highlight file was done by Warwick Allison and subsequent work by the
[contributors](./CONTRIBUTORS.md) without whom this would not be possible.

I strongly suggest you use one of the excellent bundle managers or add it as a submodule under your
bundle directory.

Enjoy,
Peter Hoeg
